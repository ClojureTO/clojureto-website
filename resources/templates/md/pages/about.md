Toronto is not for everybody. It is for those who endeavor with purpose and personality. If you live in Toronto you know who you are and you are welcome to be who you are. Toronto is plural, but also singular. Nobody is upset about the crazy weather because it can not become any crazier than people who live there. They embrace as natural what others consider odd. It is a metropolis of people living out of their comfort zone. Entrepreneurs, immigrants, students, runners, all facing a day after the other with grace and resilience.
