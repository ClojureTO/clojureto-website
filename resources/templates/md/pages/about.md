Toronto is not for everybody. It is for those who endeavor with purpose and personality. If you live in Toronto you know who you are and you are welcome to be who you are. Toronto is plural, but also singular. Nobody is upset about the crazy weather because it can't be any crazier than the people who live there. They embrace as natural what others consider odd. It is a metropolis of those living out of their comfort zone. Entrepreneurs, immigrants, students, runners, all facing a day after the other with grace and resilience.

Clojure feels at home in Toronto. A community of open minded people that felt the spark for Clojure - only to struggle in every other language - meets once a month to welcome Clojure knowledge and share their joy. From novice to expert, from job offers to conference organization, from website content to bug fixes, everyone has space to express themselves and contribute to the collective knowledge.

If your curiosity to know more about Clojure is mounting to levels you can't control or you already know Clojure but can't find anyone to share your excitement, then join ClojureTO today! We have a [Slack][1] channel for notifications and short talks, a [Meetup][2] group for events, and this website to record our history, projects, and outstanding experiences.
