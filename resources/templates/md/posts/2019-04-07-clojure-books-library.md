5 years ago I failed to write a book. I wrote it until chapter 3 but I couldn't stand all the criticism coming from the editor and the reviewers. As the deadline to deliver chapter 4 was approaching, I was still overwhelmed by all the work to catch up with their feedback. So, I quit, but I've learned something very important from that experience: the scrutiny over the writing of books makes then reliable references.

It's true that the time books need to be written and published is incompatible with the rapid pace Information Technology evolves, making them quickly obsolete. However, Clojure is well known by its long term stability and backwards compatibility. Its books have a very slow obsolescence, making them worth buying.

What if you are not yet convinced that Clojure is the best programming language out there and you don't want to prematurely start your [Clojure book collection][1]? The [Toronto Public Library][2] is the answer.
