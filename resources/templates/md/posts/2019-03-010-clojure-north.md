Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever go to a Clojure conference again after they introduced [ClojureTV][1].

I changed my mind when I met Nikola Peric. Not because he convinced me that conferences are great, but because we've meet each other and that's what happens in conferences: the chance to meet great people.
