Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever attend a Clojure conference again after they launched [ClojureTV][1] on YouTube. They publish every Clojure talk that happens out there. I wonder how those who paid to attend those conferences feel after seeing what they paid for given for free on the web?

Then I met Nikola Peric, the VP of IT at company called [Synqrinus][2], to talk about a conference he is organizing in Toronto for the Clojure community. Nikola is clearly an entrepreneur because when I ask him to tell me about himself he described his company instead - "... we are pushing the boundaries in the market research space with our technology and tools. There, I focus on architecting and leading the development of our _secret weapons_ that give us a competitive advantage in the industry". 

He was not aware of my opportunistic feelings about conferences. He was convinced on the contrary given his enthusiasm - "It's about cultivating and growing the Clojure community. We all have amazing ideas and they're worth sharing, both internally, and to the broader programming and even business community", he said. Then he opened up a bit about himself - "In my university days I would organize some of the largest undergraduate debating competitions in Canada, and even to this day help organize Canada's largest undergraduate mooting competition with over 300 attendees", he continued.

This Clojure conference he is talking about is called [Clojure/north][3] - "We liked Clojure/north's play on Clojure/west. After all, we are north of the States", he noted. They wanted to have a conference that was accessible and low-cost. They expected a base ticket price of just C$50, but that was far from realistic. So, they settled on C$180 with the extra help of sponsors. Disclosing that price was when he got my attention. After all, a lot of tech conferences go for minimum of c$500!

Nikola is not doing all this alone. The core team consists of [Dmitri Sotnikov][4], [Carmen La][5], [Raey Ang][6], and [Lubov Soltan][7]. "Dmitri is reaching out many of our speakers and drumming up interest in the event. Carmen slapped together the entire website in no time at all, and helps out with general organization. Raey is the AV coordinator/producer for the event, bringing in expertise from the film industry to keep it all professional and high-quality. Lubov designed the minimalist logo, and has helped with other design aspects such as our gorgeous sponsor package", he detailed then completed - "I tend to do a lot of the administrative tasks such as managing the Twitter account, venue registration, emails, etc. Dmitri, Carmen, and myself talk through the strategy, and programming for the event. We have a fantastic team!". He got me a second time here because I'm a big fan of Dmitri, the author of [Web Development with Clojure][8], which was the first Clojure book I read from cover to cover.

--We A big factor that the entire team considered when making is "how do we demonstrate where Clojure is having a huge impact in the real world?" We wanted people to tell us their stories about how Clojure helped them grow, or why they adopted it -- the benefits it reaped, along with the struggles and challenges that came with it. In doing so, I hope that we can encourage broader adoption of the language in the business world. That said, there's certainly variety in place -- we all like to see the more theoretical or advanced topics to up our game as developers, so you'll certainly get a mix of those in, too, especially if you look at the advanced stream. It's aimed to be a "best of both worlds" conference -- where newcomers and less technically savvy people can feel welcome, as well as veterans of the language who are looking for the next innovations or to broaden their knowledge.

--One of the motivators for the event was that Clojure, now a mature language used in production in many companies in Toronto and around the world, has a hard time finding developers to work in it! You hire for JS developers, and you'll get tons of applicants, but Clojure you'd be hard-pressed to find any developers in it. I'm hoping that Clojure/north can help contribute to broader interest in the language in the city, especially with the student tickets and dual streams (one which is more accessible to newcomers). Moreover, I'm excited that there's currently three big open source launches that will coincide with the event from our speakers so that will be a big impact. Beyond that, just hoping to grow the community in general, in Toronto and abroad, by demonstrating how Clojure is used at scale in production across the world.

--It's floored me how wide the reach of the Clojure community is. There's people from all corners of the world, including Finland, Japan, Russia, Pakistan, and South Africa who have are coming. We're all excited to have them and hope this can continue to be an accessible and diverse conference for many years to come. We'll also be professional recording the talks so hopefully those who are unable to attend will see the talks in a few weeks after the event.

--The best part, by far, connecting all these people in the Clojure community in one place. I'm thrilled to meet all these big names, and see some fantastic talks so it's kind of a win-win -- get to have all of it happen in my back yard, and also allow others to partake in the same experience! That and the event organizing geek inside me loves it when everything starts coming together well. It's not to say there's not a lot of work involved, myself and everyone on the team has put in many many hours, and I'm sure countless more will come.

If anyone is interested in volunteering their time at the event do feel free to reach out at hello@clojurenorth.com, we do need a few volunteers. Also, if anyone works at a Clojure company we'd appreciate any additional sponsorship to help finance the event.
