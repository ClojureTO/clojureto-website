About the company:
1. What is the meaning behind the name "Synqrinus"?

Synqrinus is an agile market research company that evolved from a traditional consultancy named QRI. Under QRI, Andrew Spicer, the managing director of the company developed a qualitative chat platform that allows for "synchronous chats". The name Synqrinus evolved from wanting to retain our roots from QRI (found in the middle of the name) and combine it with the innovations that were being developed.

2. What is the main problem Synqrinus is solving? Has the company ever pivoted since the beginning? If yes, how was the transition?

Synqrinus is about offering fast and creative solutions to market research questions. We pride ourselves in developing new tools, research techniques, and products to answer any sort of questions our clients may have (in record time). The evolution was natural, coming from simply solving real problems people had using technology and new research methodologies.

About the city:

3. Is Toronto a welcoming city for entrepreneurs? If not, what could be better?

I'd say so, there's a lot of support from government funding and other institutions (MaRS, Ryerson's incubator) that offer a good launching point for entrepreneurs. As long as that and an open mindset continues, I think Toronto is a great place for tech innovation.
About Clojure:

4. How Clojure is used at Synqrinus?

We use it across the stack on almost all of our technologies. The exceptions would be legacy technology and some products we outsourced for development a few years ago. Given we're a small team, Clojure enables us to do a lot with very little, and act as a great hiring filter for smart, self-learners. Our biggest codebase, which essentially does the majority of our analytics work, is only around 20,000 lines of code which makes it maintainable. You get this power with Clojure that you might not see with some more verbose languages. Our stack includes ring, shadow-cljs, compojure-api (though moving to reitit), and re-frame. For some non-SPA applications, we forgo react for back-end rendering via selmer.

5. Why Clojure was considered in the first place? Why not another technology?

Initially Clojure was suggested as a DSL for a custom survey platform being developed for Synqrinus. Prior to that, the company had a lot of C# and Java technologies present for internal tooling. As time went on, I pushed for a move to Clojure, arguing that you could build websites a lot faster with Clojure than the other languages used internally at the time.
A big feature from Clojure was the Java interop, allowing us access to the entirety of the Java ecosystem for libraries. This meant that the cost of switching to this 'fringe' language could be mitigated since we didn't have to reinvent the wheel for every single problem, but, rather, could rely on existing libraries for support.

About people and culture:

6. What does Synqrinus look for in a potential candidate for a Clojure position?

When hiring for a Clojure position it's a miracle to find someone already working with the language. As a result, you have to tweak your requirements and expectations. For juniors, you'd primarily want someone with an eagerness to learn and, ideally, some functional programming exposure. For senior positions, polygots who can communicate their thinking well are all good signs.

7. What a potential candidate may expect from the experience of working at Synqrinus?

The first week would be orientation with the team, and rest of the company. You'd learn about what market research is and how all the technologies we build and maintain piece together in this broader business. Moving on, regardless of Clojure familiarity, we'd have you work your way up from small issues to bigger. Beyond that, you'd work with a small team of a three or four other developers, having ownership over small problems or projects that come your way. This means that within the first couple of weeks, you'll likely write code that ships to production and has a meaningful impact on others working here, or our clients, or our survey takers.

8. What is the culture of the company like?

Synqrinus has a 'word-hard, play-hard' culture. Some months are busy for some teams, and others are not. We often let off steam with D&D nights, company outings such as axe throwing, ping pong. Other times we give back to the community by helping out at a soup kitchen, volunteering, or raising money for a good cause. Lastly, our owner wants everyone working here to stay happy and healthy, which results in very generous benefits and four-week vacation across the board.

9. Is remote work an option? If no, why not?

I think it's primarily a trust and preference thing; I trust all my team members to do their job, regardles of where they work from and what times they choose to work at. As a preference, I don't like to micromanage, and, therefore, don't feel the need to constantly have my team members next to me constantly looking over their shoulder. It's results in much greater satisfaction and quality of work, in my opinion, to empower and be able to trust the people you work with. For the software team, we have a work from home policy and are open to remote work.
